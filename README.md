# AndroidCalendar
CS3354 Android Calendar Project

I added a time picker and date picker for the add_event since i notice you cannot pick a date or time in there. The change i make is in set_time.java and set_date.java and also in set_time and set_date layout. The one thing is that i cannot make default to the current date.
